# Mathiasâ€™s dotfiles (reaperhulk's fork)
## This fork has diverged significantly from https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reaperhulk/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install.sh
```

This will create symlinks, not copy. You can then update with a fresh git pull at any time.
